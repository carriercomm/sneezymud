Do 'svn update' periodically to keep your dev code in sync with the
production code.  This will merge in other coders changes with your
dev code.  You should try and do this pretty frequently.

You can do 'svn status' to quickly see the status of your code changes
without merging in new code yet.

---

When you are ready to move your changes into production, do 'svn
commit'.  Also leave a comment about your code changes.  Try to be
somewhat detailed.
"Fixed bug." => bad
"Fixed bug in doSomething()" => better
"Fixed buffer overflow on name variable in doSomething()" => good

---

If you fucked up a file and want to discard your version, simply
remove it and do 'svn update' to checkout the production version.

---

To compile your own dev code:
./build.sh start

To boot your dev mud:
./boot.sh start

You may have to use another port if 6969 is being used.  You can
modify boot.sh to include a port for you.

---

To do a code move:
cd /mud/build
svn update
./build.sh start
<wait for build to finish>
./mvcode.csh

---

Do not ever edit the code in /mud/build.  It is only a snapshot of the
production code, for compiling.

---

The lib directory is linked to /mud/build/lib.  You don't have your own
copy of lib, so be aware that svn doesn't have any affect on those
files EXCEPT for /mud/build/lib/zonefiles.

---

The zonefiles in /mud/build/lib/zonefiles are in SVN.  If you make
changes to those files you must do a svn commit from that directory to
check in your changes.  The mvlow script automatically handles the
transfer to prod, after your changes are checked into SVN.
