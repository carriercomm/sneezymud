Do 'cvs update' periodically to keep your dev code in sync with the
production code.  This will merge in other coders changes with your
dev code.  You should try and do this pretty frequently.

---

When you are ready to move your changes into production, do 'cvs
commit'.

---

If you fucked up a file and want to discard your version, simply
remove it and do 'cvs update' to checkout the production version.

---

To compile your own dev code:
rm file.mak ; make >& file.mak &

To boot your dev mud:
./sneezy.2 6969 >& file &

I'll probably update bmake and alboot to work with the dev
environments, right now you have to do it manually.  You may have to
use another port if 6969 is being used.

---

To do a code move:
cd /mud/code
cvs update
bmake
sneezymode
mvcode
exit

---

Do not ever edit the code in /mud/code.  It is only a snapshot of the
production code, for compiling.

---

The lib directory is linked to /mud/code/lib.  You don't have your own
copy of lib, so be aware that cvs doesn't have any affect on those
files.

---

CVS has many other options and abilities.  Try 'cvs help' for more
details.  Also: http://cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs.html
