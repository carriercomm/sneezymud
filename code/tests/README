To make a new test:

1) Copy template.h to a new file for your test (eg, "cp template.h myTest.h")
2) Edit the class name in your new file (eg, "template" -> "myTest")
3) Add your test to SConscript
4) Start adding tests and stuff.

Documentation on the testing facilities here:
http://cxxtest.com/guide.html
alternate: http://cxxtest.sourceforge.net/guide.html

- To run tests, do "scons check" in the code directory.
- If you need to see the mud output from your tests (what would
normally end up in the mud log), check the tests/output directory.
