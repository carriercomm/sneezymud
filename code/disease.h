 A note on diseases in SneezyMUD ...  Diseases are simply periodically
 activated affects.  I.e., every so often, if a mob/player is affected by
 a disease then a special procedure related to that specific disease is
 called.   There may be other places where affects are checked for and
 called.  These will vary from disease to disease.  The important thing
 to remember when creating/thinking of diseases is that the goal is not
 to burden the player but to enrich playing.  That wount stop me from 
 writing disease_herpes, however.
